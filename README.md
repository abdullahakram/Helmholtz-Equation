# Implementation for Helmholtz Equation

The Helmholtz equation is a partial differential equation that describes the behavior of wave-like phenomena in physics and engineering, such as acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. The equation is named after Hermann von Helmholtz, a German physicist and mathematician who first derived it.

The Helmholtz equation takes the form:

∇²u(x) + k²u(x) = 0

where u(x) is a scalar function of the position vector x, k is the wave number, and ∇² is the Laplace operator, which is a second-order differential operator that describes the curvature or divergence of a vector field.

The Helmholtz equation arises in many physical problems, such as the propagation of sound waves in a room, the electromagnetic field in a waveguide, or the flow of a fluid over an obstacle. In these problems, the solution u(x) represents the amplitude or potential of the wave at each point in space, and the wave number k determines its frequency and wavelength.

Solving the Helmholtz equation is a fundamental problem in many fields of science and engineering, as it allows us to predict and control the behavior of wave-like phenomena. The equation can be solved analytically for simple geometries and boundary conditions, but in general, it requires numerical methods such as finite element, finite difference, or boundary element methods. These methods discretize the domain and approximate the solution by solving a system of linear or nonlinear equations.


In this implementation, we first define the problem domain, which is a one-dimensional interval [0, L]. We also specify the number of grid points N and the wave number k. Next, we define the boundary conditions at x=0 and x=L, which are given by the sine function.

We then set up the finite difference matrix A using a second-order central difference approximation to the Laplacian operator. This matrix is a discretized version of the Helmholtz equation, and it is a linear system of equations that we can solve to obtain the numerical solution u.

Finally, we solve the linear system using the numpy.linalg.solve function and plot the numerical solution u(x) along with the exact solution given by the sine function.
